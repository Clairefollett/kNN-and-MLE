**To run this project:**\
*python knn.py*

This is a fun little project that implements k Nearest Neighbors on a binary classification problem using Euclidean distance.\
This project also implements K-fold Cross Validation to validate the implementation and choose hyperparameters.\
The data is split into a training set with 8,000 labeled rows and a test set with 2,000 unlabeled rows.
